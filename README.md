# Vacuum Energy
Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Claus W. Turtur researched in the field of vacuum energy or zero-point-energy. According to his research it is possible to convert the energy of the zero-point-oscillations of the quantum vacuum into classical mechanical energy (electrostatic rotor experiment). Furthermore due to the finite propagation velocity of electromagnetic waves (maybe caused by the vacuum energy) it is possible to develop systems that convert the energy of the vacuum into electrical and mechanical energy in a usable range of power. His simulations of EMDR-Converter (electro-mechanical-double-resonance-converter) show power outputs in the kilowatt range.

The folder "originals" contains all the simulation calculations from his paper series "1_Serie-deutsch-5Artikel.pdf" (or "1_Series-english-5Articles.pdf").

You can find some of his research including the mentioned papers under https://web.archive.org/web/20180917161851/https://www2.ostfalia.de/cms/de/pws/turtur/FundE.

"program_04" contains the EMDR-Converter (electro-mechanical-double-resonance-converter) simulation program.
